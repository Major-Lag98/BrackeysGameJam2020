# BrackeysGameJam2020
A really crappy game probably.

Name is "From Whence We Came", Made in 1 week. A platformer game where in order to progress further in the game you manipulate time. We are in a ruin. In the present the ruin is destroyed and cumbled in spots, in the past the ruin is upkept with tight security. You must make it to the end by going back and forth through time.

Made for Brackeys Game Jam 2020.
