# BrackeysGameJam2020
A really crappy game probably.

Made in ~4days. A platformer game where in order to progress further in the game you manipulate time. We are in a ruin. In the present the ruin is destroyed and caved in, in the past the ruin is upkept with tight security. You must make it to the end by going back and forth through time.

Made for Brackeys Game Jam 2020.
